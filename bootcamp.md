# Programming Bootcamp

## Introduction and Prerequisites
For this guide to be most helpful, it will be beneficial to have a basic understanding of the purpose of a computer program and access to a development environment to test these programs. However, the guide will have a brief overview of the basics of programming and computing. Feel free to skip ahead to areas that you feel will be most useful.

This guide will teach introductory program through the C programming language. In Cyclone Robosub, you'll be working primarily in C, C++, and Python. For Battle Boats, you'll be working in either C or C++. 

## Basics
### What is a program?
A program is a series of steps that your computer completes in order to solve a problem or complete a task. For example, you might write a program to:
- Calculate the area of a circle
- Pick a random card from a deck
- Control an automated sprinkler system

or anything else that a computer can do.

One key thing to remember when programming is that your computer will only do what you tell it to, and in the order that you tell it to. It is not smart, and will not infer anything that you do not write explicitly.

Programs are written in English text, and then transformed into binary (1s and 0s) that the computer can read. This is a process known as "compilation". Some languages, like C, compile the whole program at once. Other languages, like Python, compile the code bit-by-bit as the program runs. These languages are known as interpreted languages. For now, we'll just focus on C, a compiled language.

C programs are written (in English) in files that use the ".c" file extension, like "main.c". Remember, you cannot run ".c" files! Compilation is what turns the source code file (".c") into an executable file that can be run (executed) on your computer. In Windows, these end in ".exe". On MacOS or Linux, there isn't a specific file extension. *Remember that if you change your source code, you need to recompile the code for the change to take effect!*
